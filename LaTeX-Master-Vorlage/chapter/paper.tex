\chapter{Paper} \label{c:Paper}
In this chapter we will examine the topic of the paper \textit{Stable Neo-Hookean Flesh Simulation}. The goal of the paper was to model deformations for virtual characters that have human-like features. They concentrated on the deformation energy.

\section{Energy Formulation}

For our needs we need a hyperelastic energy that is stable in the following four important ways:

\begin{itemize}
\item Inversion stability
\item Reflection stability
\item Rest stability
\item Meta-stability under degeneracy
\end{itemize}

TODO: explain each step

\subsection{Previous Work}
Here comes previous work in neo-hookean energy formulation. What is neo-hookean and why do we need it here?
And what is wrong with each one.
